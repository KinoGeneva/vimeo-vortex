# Vimeo Vortex

A WordPress plugin that adds some functionality to improve vimeo embeds.

Most importantly, it uses the Vimeo API to load information about the video. 

Based on that, we can build a preview that is just an image, rather than an iframe. When the user clicks on it, we create the iframe and play the video.

When used on pages that load a large amount of videos, that makes a big difference in terms of performance / speed!
